## Problem 1

**This chunk loads and describes the `early_january_weather` dataset
from the moderndive library**

``` r
#loads dataset early_january_weather
data("early_january_weather")

# calculates and saves value for the mean, median, and standard deviation of temperature variable
mean_temp <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
median_temp <- median(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
std_temp <- sd(pull(early_january_weather, temp))

# calculates and saves value the mean, median, and standard deviation of temperature variable
mean_humid <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
median_humid <- median(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
std_humid <- sd(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
```

**The dataset `early_january_weather` includes meterological data for
LGA, JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013 and contains 358
observations (rows) representing hourly measurements and 15 variables
(columns):**

- `origin` - weather station (LGA, JFK, EWR)
- `year` - year at time of recording (2013)
- `month` - month at time of recording (1)
- `day` - day of the month at time of recording (1, 15)
- `hour` - hour of the day at time of recording (0, 23)
- `temp` - temperature (degrees F, *mean*: 39.58, *median*: 39.02,
  *std*: 7.06)
- `dewp` - dewpoint (degrees F)
- `humid` - relative humidity (*mean*: 65.48, *median*: 61.67, *std*:
  18.95)
- `wind_dir` - wind direction (degrees)
- `wind_speed` - wind speed (mph)
- `wind_gust` - wind gust speed (mph)
- `precip` - precipitation (inches)
- `pressure` - sea level pressure (milibars)
- `visib` - visibility (miles)
- `time_hour` - date and hour of recording as a POSIXct date

# 

**This chunk makes a scatterplot of temperature by date/hour of
recording**

``` r
# gives scatter plot of temperature by date/hour of recording and color coded based on relative humidity
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```

![](p8105_hw1_mas2514_files/figure-gfm/scatterplot-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
ggsave("jan_weather_plot.pdf", height = 5, width = 7)
```

The scatterplot above shows the hourly temperature recordings from
January 1st to 15th, with point color representing the relative humidity
at the time of the recording. The temperature recordings display a daily
pattern of rising during the day and falling at night, with most of the
recordings staying within a range of 30 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. Across
the two week recording period, temperatures appear relatively stable but
with a dip at the start of January and a peak by mid-January, suggesting
a slight warming trend. Relative humidity is more variable, with lower
humidity clustering in the early part of the month and higher humidity
values becoming more common toward the middle of the month. Notably,
there is a cluster of recordings around January 12-13th with lower
temperature variability throughout the day and high relative humidity.
