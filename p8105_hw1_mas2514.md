## Problem 1

**This chunk loads and describes the `early_january_weather` dataset
from the moderndive library**

``` r
#loads dataset early_january_weather
data("early_january_weather")

# calculates and saves value for the mean, median, and standard deviation of temperature variable
mean_temp <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
median_temp <- median(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
std_temp <- sd(pull(early_january_weather, temp))

# calculates and saves value the mean, median, and standard deviation of temperature variable
mean_humid <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
median_humid <- median(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
std_humid <- sd(pull(early_january_weather, humid))
```

**The dataset `early_january_weather` includes meterological data for
LGA, JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013 and contains 358
observations (rows) representing hourly measurements and 15 variables
(columns):**

- `origin` - weather station (LGA, JFK, EWR)
- `year` - year at time of recording (2013)
- `month` - month at time of recording (1)
- `day` - day of the month at time of recording (1, 15)
- `hour` - hour of the day at time of recording (0, 23)
- `temp` - temperature (degrees F, *mean*: 39.58, *median*: 39.02,
  *std*: 7.06)
- `dewp` - dewpoint (degrees F)
- `humid` - relative humidity (*mean*: 65.48, *median*: 61.67, *std*:
  18.95)
- `wind_dir` - wind direction (degrees)
- `wind_speed` - wind speed (mph)
- `wind_gust` - wind gust speed (mph)
- `precip` - precipitation (inches)
- `pressure` - sea level pressure (milibars)
- `visib` - visibility (miles)
- `time_hour` - date and hour of recording as a POSIXct date

# 

**This chunk makes a scatterplot of temperature by date/hour of
recording**

``` r
# gives scatter plot of temperature by date/hour of recording and color coded based on relative humidity
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()
```
