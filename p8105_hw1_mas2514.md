# Problem 1

### This chunk loads the ‘early_january_weather’ dataset from the moderndive library

``` r
#loads dataset early_january_weather
data("early_january_weather")

# gives the size of the dataset by rows and columns
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
# calculates the mean temperature
mean_temp <- mean(pull(early_january_weather, temp))
```
